# Datagarden
A sample gardening app intended to test the limits of Redux to create a full app with very limited prop drilling and no back-end/database. Users have access to a full CRUD to view/add/delete/edit plants within the app, and the use of the tables and charts allow easy access to reference data for quick use. Should users want to save their plants and access them later, handy functionality with the "save plants" and "load plants" buttons will allow the saving and loading of state, respectively, within local storage.

```javascript
        case EDIT_PLANT:    
            return {    
                ...state,    
                plants: state.plants.map(    
                    (plant) => plant.id === action.payload.id ? {...plant,
                        id: action.payload.id, 
                        name: action.payload.name, 
                        plantDate : action.payload.plantDate, 
                        growTime: action.payload.growTime, 
                        idealWater: action.payload.idealWater, 
                        idealSun: action.payload.idealSun, 
                        picture: action.payload.picture } : plant)    
            };   
```

## Features

#### Datagarden is an exercise in the functionality of Redux to allow the construction of a full global state with very limited use of prop drilling or a back-end.
- Different views in the form of data cards, tables, and charts allow for easy representation of your planting data, for future use without memorization.
- Even without the use of a database, users can save their plants within local storage and later load the same so that their plant data is never lost.
- Comprehensive data on growing plants in your garden, such as average grow times, ideal water per week, and ideal sun conditions.
- Fully mobile-responsive site.

## Usage
- The initial Redux state of the application is pre-loaded with 6 plants, to demonstrate the functionality of the app throughout the different views. Should the user wish to delete them, they can use the 'Delete Plant' buttons at the bottom of each card on the homepage. They can be more effectively removed from state by using the "Save State" button on the header, to allow users to always load state (with the 'Load State' button) without these pre-loaded plants.
- Should users want to add more plants, please use the 'Add Plant' button on the header. It will prompt users for descriptive data about the plant as well as picture links, to track this data later. They will be applied to state and automatically populate the pages.
- In the same vein, if users want to edit data for an existing plant, they can use the 'Edit Plant' button within each card on the homepage. This will offer a similar prompt as the 'Add' functionality, but values will be pre-filled with the current values.
- Users can easily track important data using the Table page, which offers a simple table displaying grow times, plant times, etc.
- For an easy visualization of growing times between plants, the Charts page uses Chart.js to show comparisons in a bar chart.
