# Datagarden
A sample gardening app intended to test the limits of Redux to create a full app with very limited prop drilling and no back-end/database. Users have access to a full CRUD to view/add/delete/edit plants within the app, and the use of the tables and charts allow easy access to reference data for quick use. Should users want to save their plants and access them later, handy functionality with the "save plants" and "load plants" buttons will allow the saving and loading of state, respectively, within local storage.

```javascript
        case EDIT_PLANT:    
            return {    
                ...state,    
                plants: state.plants.map(    
                    (content, i) => content.id === action.payload.id ? {...content,
                        id: action.payload.id, 
                        name: action.payload.name, 
                        plantDate : action.payload.plantDate, 
                        growTime: action.payload.growTime, 
                        idealWater: action.payload.idealWater, 
                        idealSun: action.payload.idealSun, 
                        picture: action.payload.picture } : content)
            };

## Features

#### Datagarden is an exercise in the functionality of Redux to allow the construction of a full global state with very limited use of prop drilling or a back-end.
- Different views in the form of data cards, tables, and charts allow for easy representation of your planting data, for future use without memorization.
- Even without the use of a database, users can save their plants within local storage and later load the same so that their plant data is never lost.
- Fully mobile-responsive site.
